The program will look for the environment variable CDDB and the string
filename will be set to that value if CDDB exists.  If CDDB does not exist,
the string filename will be set to a default value, "albums.db."
The environment variable needs to be entered by the user on the command line
as an exported environment variable before executing the script to have the
Python code traverse the appropriate albums database, e.g. "export
CDDB="al.db"" will set the filename in the Python program as "al.db" when it
is executed.

The Python program is called a4.py.
The  makefile target "build" copies the text from a4.py and puts it in a new
file named cddb and has a4.py as a dependency.  Then, cddb is given execution
permissions.  This is the default target, so calling either "make build" or
"make" will create the executable.
The makefile target "clean" removes cddb and has cddb as a dependency.  Clean
can be executed by calling "make clean."
The makefile target "view" prints out the text contained in the file a4.py
and has a4.py as a dependency.  View can be executed by calling "make view."

The program can run one command at a time and the program quits after that
command has completed.

I have submitted my "albums.db" albums database just as an additional
reference and/or testing point because it tests all possible options for
albums, including multiple albums released in the same year for the same
artist, multiple albums released in the same year for different artist, and so
on.
