1. The reason I did not include the file philly_loc.py and, rather, copied the
function and put it into my findStops.py file is because in the "What to hand
in" section, it only specified to turn in the findStops.py file.  This led me
to believe that I needed to incorporate the getLoc() function into my file
rather than include the file and use the function that way.

2. My final dictionary contains keys that are the string that will be output
in the end and values that are the distance from the current location
(generated).  Within the key, the distance is already there, so I did not call
the key and value when I printed out the stations by distance because the key
already contained the distance from the current location in it.  However, I
still did use the distance value when I sorted the dictionary by value, thus
proving use for the values of the dictionary.
