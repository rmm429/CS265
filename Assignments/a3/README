Since there was no defined way to exit the code in the instructions and we
were not allowed to prompt at all, the only way to exit the code is by Ctrl+C
(or something similar to that).

Because of this, by running "ant," my build.xml file will never get to the
"clean" target because the code is killed before "clean" can run.

So, to actually clean, the command "ant clean" has to be executed.  Just "ant"
will run the code and allow for input but not clean, and just "ant clean" will
not run the code but perform the clean correctly.
