Two functions are used here to complete the procedure of recursively going
through subdirectories and creating xml files.

The only weird thing I noticed is that the terminal outputs that no
README files exist, but this only happens occassionally and very minimally
compared to how many subdirectories I traversed through in my test.
If you find out why this is happening, I would love to know the reason for
this small error.

Other than that, the code still works fine and all of the xml files are
produced appropriately.
